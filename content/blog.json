      "description": "This post answers the frequently asked questions regarding the Matrix Land\npre-sale. All the members are requested to go through it for better\nunderstanding about the Matrix World and the pre-sale activity.\n\n 1.  Can I still buy Flow Lands? / Is the second wave over?\n     Sorry, the second wave of the presale is officially over. All of the\n     available Flow Lands have sold out.\n 2.  I still have vouchers and see a timer, but it says the Lands are sold out.\n     Can I still buy Lands?\n     No, you can no longer buy Flow Lands because they are sold out. The second\n     wave was done on a First Come First Served basis, so you had to claim your\n     Land Vouchers before they sold out OR before the time expired, whichever\n     happened first.\n 3.  I didn’t get to claim my Land Vouchers on the second wave before it ended,\n     can I claim them during the third wave?\n     No, the Flow Vouchers and the Ethereum vouchers are separate.

      "description": "Matrix World is offering 5000 Lands on FLOW blockchain and the accepted payment\nis FLOW through , which is a Flow supported wallet.\n\nThis post will discuss all the possible ways to get FLOW in your Blocto wallet.\n\nFLOW is a native token of Flow blockchain and it’s listed on the following\nExchanges.\n\nTHE FLOW SUPPORTED EXCHANGES:\n\n 1. \n    Available Pairs: FLOW/USD, FLOW/EUR, FLOW/BTC, FLOW/ETH, FLOW/GBP\n 2. \n    Available Pairs: FLOW/USDT\n 3. \n    Available Pairs: FLOW/USDT\n 4. \n 5. \n    Available Pairs: FLOW/USDT, FLOW/BTC\n 6. (not available for now)\n    Available Pairs: FLOW/USDT, FLOW/BUSD, FLOW/BTC\n\nMETHOD 1: BUY FLOW TOKENS FROM ANY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED EXCHANGES AND THEN\nTRANSFER TO THE BLOCTO WALLET USING BLOCTO WALLET ADDRESS THAT YOU USED TO APPLY\nFOR PRESALE\n\nIf you’re a user of any of the above-mentioned exchanges, you can swap your\ntokens with FLOW tokens and then receive them on the Flow blockchain using . The\napplicants already have a wallet address that they used to apply for the\npresale. They need to use the same wallet address to receive the Flow tokens\nfrom any of the above-mentioned exchanges in the Blocto wallet. The address can\nbe found by logging into the Matrix World website as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe next step is to go to any of the above-mentioned exchanges and withdraw the\nFlow token to the address that you used for the presale application.\n\nFor better understanding, we’ll elaborate how to receive FLOW tokens from the\nKaraken exchange to the Blocto wallet\n\nIf you have any tokens in your Binance, Kraken, Gate.io, Huobi Global Exchange,\nyou need to swap them into USDT, for Kraken users, you need to complete the\nIntermediate verify so that you can deposit cash into your Kraken account. You\ncan swap Flow with USD dollar, Euro, Ethereum or BTC etc. The next step is to\nwithdraw your Flow from Kraken to Blocto wallet. So, you’ll have the FLOW in\nyour wallet now. On other Exchanges, if you don’t have any cryptocurrency in\nyour wallet, you can simply buy from peer to peer using your local currency,\nsuch as USD to USDT.\n\nMETHOD 2: BUY FLOW TOKENS DIRECTLY FROM BLOCTO WALLET USING A THIRD-PARTY\n(MOONPAY) PAYMENT SERVICE\n\nThe Blocto wallet lets users directly buy cryptocurrencies using a third-party\npayment service called MoonPay. For that, you need need to log in to the Blocto\nmobile application using the same email and wallet address that you used to\napply for the presale. And then click on the buy icon, select the desired\ncryptocurrency, and the payment currency such as US Dollar ($), New Taiwan\nDollar (NT$), Japanese Yen (¥), etc. Once you have filled in this information,\nyou’ll be prompted to fill in some basic information such as name, address,\ncountry, and you’ll have to verify your identity using the required documents\nsuch as a driving license or national id card. The last step is to fill in the\ncard information to make payment. The amount in your chosen currency unit will\nbe deducted from your ATM card and the cryptocurrency i.e., FLOW tokens would be\nreceived in your Blocto wallet.
